# Continuous Integration

Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. Continuous integration most often refers to the build or integration stage of the software release process and entails both an automation component (e.g. a CI or build service) and a cultural component (e.g. learning to integrate frequently).

**Continuous Integration Benefits**

- Find and address bugs quicker
  With more frequent testing, your team can discover and address bugs earlier before they grow into larger problems later.
- Improve Developer Productivity
  Continuous integration helps your team be more productive by freeing developers from manual tasks and encouraging behaviors that help reduce the number of errors and bugs released to customers.
- Improve software quality
- Deliver Updates Faster
  Continuous integration helps your team deliver updates to their customers faster and more frequently

# Continuous Delivery

Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production.

**Continuous Delivery Benefits**

- Automate the Software Release Process
  Continuous delivery lets your team automatically build, test, and prepare code changes for release to production so that your software delivery is more efficient and rapid
- Improve Developer Productivity
  These practices help your team be more productive by freeing developers from manual tasks and encouraging behaviors that help reduce the number of errors and bugs deployed to customers.
- Find and Address Bugs Quicker
  Your team can discover and address bugs earlier before they grow into larger problems later with more frequent and comprehensive testing. Continuous delivery lets you more easily perform additional types of tests on your code because the entire process has been automated
- Deliver Updates Faster
  Continuous delivery helps your team deliver updates to customers faster and more frequently. When continuous delivery is implemented properly, you will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process.

# Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment

With continuous delivery, every code change is built, tested, and then pushed to a non-production testing or staging environment. There can be multiple, parallel test stages before a production deployment. The difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment is the presence of a manual approval to update to production. With continuous deployment, production happens automatically without explicit approval.
